        <li>
          Stir together warm water, yeast, and brown sugar in a large mixing
          bowl; let sit for 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Stir oil and salt into yeast mixture. Mix in 2 1/2 cups flour until
          incorporated. Turn dough out onto a clean, floured surface. Knead
          dough, adding remaining flour, a little at a time, until dough is no
          longer sticky. Place dough into an oiled bowl.

        <br />
        <li>
          Punch down dough and form it into a tight ball. Allow dough to relax
          for 1 minute before rolling out.

        </li>
        <br />
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <br />
        <li>
          If baking dough on a pizza stone, place toppings on dough and bake
          immediately. If baking dough on a pan, lightly oil the pan and let
          dough rise for 15 to 20 minutes before topping and baking it.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and crust is golden
          brown, 15 to 20 minutes.
